# Changes to statrep_flet_app_v3_prod.py

## The Real Problem
We were using the WRONG Flet API for dialogs!

### Wrong Way (what we were doing):
```python
page.dialog = my_dialog
my_dialog.open = True
page.update()
```

### Correct Way (Flet's actual API):
```python
page.open(my_dialog)  # To show
page.close(my_dialog)  # To hide
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Dialog API Usage
Changed all dialog opening and closing to use the correct Flet methods:

**Opening dialogs:**
- OLD: `page.dialog = dialog; dialog.open = True; page.update()`
- NEW: `page.open(dialog)`

**Closing dialogs:**
- OLD: `dialog.open = False; page.update()`
- NEW: `page.close(dialog)`

### UI Improvements (Already Done)
- Both "Verify PIN" (blue) and "Change PIN" (orange) buttons are always visible
- Side-by-side layout - no more disappearing buttons
- Clearer user experience

## Files Updated

1. **statrep_flet_app_v3_prod.py** - Main app with correct dialog API
2. **test_dialog.py** - Simple test using correct API
3. **CHANGES.md** - This file

## What Was Fixed

### In `show_voluntary_pin_change()`:
- Changed from `page.dialog = voluntary_pin_dialog; voluntary_pin_dialog.open = True; page.update()`
- To: `page.open(voluntary_pin_dialog)`

### In `cancel_clicked()`:
- Changed from `voluntary_pin_dialog.open = False; page.update()`
- To: `page.close(voluntary_pin_dialog)`

### In `change_pin_clicked()` (success case):
- Changed from `voluntary_pin_dialog.open = False`
- To: `page.close(voluntary_pin_dialog)`

### In `show_pin_change_dialog()`:
- Changed from `page.dialog = pin_change_dialog; pin_change_dialog.open = True; page.update()`
- To: `page.open(pin_change_dialog)`

### In forced PIN change success:
- Changed from `pin_change_dialog.open = False`
- To: `page.close(pin_change_dialog)`

## Result

Dialogs should now appear and work correctly! This was an API usage issue, not a logic or visibility problem.

## Credit

Thanks to the user for finding the official Flet example showing the correct `page.open()` and `page.close()` methods!
